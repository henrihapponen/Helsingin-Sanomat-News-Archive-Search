### How It Works

Install Chrome and the required packages.

Run the script.

Once prompted, type in a search term and number of headlines to be returned, and press enter. 

The driver opens a tab in Chrome, press OK to accept cookies (haven't been able to automate this yet) and let the script run.

A csv file is created, which includes all the headlines resulting from that query.
